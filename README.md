# 👋 Hi, I'm Venkata Thammana

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a data scientist and AI engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems from the ground up — whether it's a neural network implemented in raw NumPy or a full Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. My work spans machine learning, NLP, MLOps, and software engineering.

## 🧠 What I’m Working On

- 🔬 **Neural Networks from Scratch** – Building fully connected architectures using just NumPy (forward & backward propagation).
- 📚 **RAG Pipelines** – Extracting and chunking content from websites, indexing with vector DBs, and querying with LLMs.
- 🧠 **Transformer Architectures** – Deep dive into the "Attention is All You Need" paper and implementing parts of it.
- ⛅ **Data Pipelines** – Working with Snowflake SQL, Dataiku, and Python to build production-grade data workflows.
- 🧪 **ML Experiments** – Running experiments with boosting methods, classical ML, and custom loss functions.
